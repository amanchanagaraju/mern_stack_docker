# MERN Stack Dockerized

This repository contains a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application, containerized using Docker. It includes Dockerfiles for the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js + Express) components, along with a `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrating the containers.

## Features

- Dockerized frontend (React) and backend (Node.js + Express) components
- MongoDB integration
- Simplified deployment using Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose should be installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanchanagaraju/mern_stack_docker.git
   cd mern_stack_docker
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment variables. Sample `.env` content:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
   PORT=5000
   ```

3. Build and start the application containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Access the application:

   - Frontend (React): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend (Express): [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/`: React frontend application
- `backend/`: Node.js + Express backend application
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration file for orchestrating the containers

## Customization

- Modify the frontend code in the `frontend/` directory.
- Customize the backend logic in the `backend/` directory.

## Notes

- This setup is intended for development purposes. For production deployment, consider adding security measures, load balancing, and other optimizations.
- MongoDB data will persist across container restarts due to Docker named volumes.
